# Blogeolio

Hello, person who is perusing my github. I am interested in static site tools that use React, and Gatsbyjs has caught my eye. Additionally, I've considered for some time that I need to revamp my website (including adding a bloge hence blogeolio) so wow this is a perfect mashup of opportunity! It is time to build a new website.
