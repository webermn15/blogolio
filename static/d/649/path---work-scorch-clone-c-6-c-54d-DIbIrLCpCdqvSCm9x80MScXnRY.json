{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Scorch Clone based on the classic DOS game Scorched Earth, which I loved as a kid. I used HTML5's Canvas element, CSS, and plain Javascript to create this game. The majority of the project was writing Javascript that directs the HTML5 Canvas element. Two to four players alternate turns adjusting the power and angle of their tanks' projectiles in an attempt to hit one another the quickest. When you're hit, you're eliminated, and the last player standing wins. </p>\n<p>This was the first project I ever \"completed\" (nothing is ever completed). It taught me a lot about some very fundamental programming concepts, such as the importance of good name conventions, debugging, trying to keep your code as DRY as possible, and most importantly staying calm in the face of a messy refactor. Scorched Earth, and by extension Scorch Clone will always hold a dear place in my heart. This was also the first project I ever considered for additional features, but it's still quite a bit far down on my list of things to work on. Maybe one day I'll rebuild it with proper online cross browser support with lobbies and player accounts. Who knows!</p>","frontmatter":{"id":4,"title":"Scorch Clone","description":"Two dimensional multiplayer artillery game","repo":"https://github.com/webermn15/Scorch_a-scorched-earth-clone/","link":"https://webermn15.github.io/Scorch_a-scorched-earth-clone"}}},"pageContext":{}}
