{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>That's right, the very website you're browsing right now! My original website overstayed it's welcome quite a bit, and when I committed to a new project, I knew I wanted to properly utilize static site building tools and implement a blog. I've been in love with Reactjs for a while, and after a bit of waffling between Gatsbyjs and Nextjs, I settled on Gatsbyjs. </p>\n<p>Gatsby has been a great development experience. The starter templates are amazing not only as a jumping off point for a project but also as great examples to see how other developers have tackled particular problems(and where the hell I'm making configuration errors in my root files). The GraphQL query system took me a moment to get a handle on, as I'd only been marginally exposed to GraphQL before delving into Gatsby, but once you grasp it it's great. The documentation is fairly thorough, although a found myself digging through other projects and old issues a few times when they did fall short. It's quite an extensive ecosystem so I can be understanding in that regard. The little bells &#x26; whistles are what really push the development experience over the top. Gatsby-Image is one of the coolest tools I've come across and super easy to get started with, and the GraphQL debugger is amazing. I've still plenty of little things to finish or improve with this site, but I've loved building it!</p>","frontmatter":{"id":2,"title":"websdev","description":"My personal website!","repo":"https://github.com/webermn15/blogolio","link":"https://websdev.io","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.9229828850855746,"src":"/static/12d288ca08c20f7ded90c8f5cfa89874/795d5/websdevthumb.png","srcSet":"/static/12d288ca08c20f7ded90c8f5cfa89874/ba824/websdevthumb.png 375w,\n/static/12d288ca08c20f7ded90c8f5cfa89874/348ed/websdevthumb.png 750w,\n/static/12d288ca08c20f7ded90c8f5cfa89874/795d5/websdevthumb.png 1500w,\n/static/12d288ca08c20f7ded90c8f5cfa89874/15f61/websdevthumb.png 1573w","sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{}}
