Welcome! 

My old site was long overdue for a replacement. I was hoping to push this site live before 2019, but a day later isn't too bad!

I'm halfway finished with two different posts right now; ideally I'll have one up this weekend. You can read about how I built this site [here](https://websdev.io/work/websdev). If you have any questions or concerns don't hesitate to [tweet](https://twitter.com/_websdev) at me!

Cheers,

Michael
