That's right, the very website you're browsing right now! My original website overstayed it's welcome quite a bit, and when I committed to a new project, I knew I wanted to properly utilize static site building tools and implement a blog. I've been in love with Reactjs for a while, and very quickly upon researching React based static site options I settled on Gatsbyjs.
